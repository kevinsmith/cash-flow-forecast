# Cash Flow Forecast

A simple app for forecasting the cash flow in and out of a single account. It's extremely useful for keeping your finances in check when recurring transactions don't all occur on the same cycle, e.g. monthly rent payments, bi-weekly paychecks, and weekly meal kit subscriptions.

## Security

This app is a self-contained, single page JavaScript app without a remote or local data store. When you refresh the page, the app is reset to its defaults. Nothing is sent off to a remote server, and you can watch the network inspector in your browser to confirm this. It's Open Source, so check it out yourself. It's worth noting that you can literally just download the `index.html` file and open it in your browser, and it'll work.

Download it, fork it, edit it, improve it. Send back a pull request if you think it would be a helpful improvement for everyone. Enjoy!
